# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

Personal Notes:

Full disclosure, I could only work on this since 21st owning to a multitute of quizzes that all the profs wanted to get done with before diwali.
I did not bring it up since it is not usually this busy for us and I did not want it to look like I was too busy to commit time to this. Also I do admit, I thought it'd be easier than it was but turns out I was at the peak of Dunning Kruger.

I have only worked on the loading page of the Classic (free) gun since all the other pages will be an exact copy with values changes. Again, this was made in a time crunch and I did the best I could but I feel like one page can be a good representative of all.

The clickable/hover elements wouldn't work for some absurd reason and I have kept the files and the commented out code for bkg image, should you wish to see them.

To conclude, I could have done better but I ran out of time. I have a couple of ideas like making the hover on layout screen show images and all of the guns and add a horizontal navbar to the top of the gun page where the photo and the price of the gun is written and it scrolls like card stack but I ended up not implimenting them.

Finally, I still think I am happy with what I did, given that I had to learn a new language and framework in 5 short days and I thank you for giving me a chance and it was an excellent learning opportunity.
